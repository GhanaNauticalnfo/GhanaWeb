1;INTRODUCTION;;;;
1,1;Project Background;;;;
;;;;;
The Volta Lake is formed by the Akosombo Dam, on which constructions works;;;;;
begun in 1961 and were completed in 1965, and which dammed the Volta River;;;;;
and created a lake extending upstream from the Akosombo Dam to Buipe and;;;;;
Yapei, beyond the former confluence of the Black Volta and White Volta rivers.;;;;;
;;;;;
With a storage capacity of 153 billion cubic-metres of water, the Volta Lake is;;;;;
one of the largest man-made lakes in the world. It is about 400 km long and;;;;;
covers 8,502 square km, or 3.6 per cent of Ghana’s area. The Lake’s creation;;;;;
involved the inundation of 15,000 homes and of 740 villages and the resettlement;;;;;
of 78,000 people. The Lake is navigable and provides a cheap route, linking;;;;;
Ghana’s northern savannah with the coast. It also is a major fishing ground and;;;;;
provides irrigation water for farmland in the dry Accra Plains lying immediately;;;;;
below the dam site. The generating capacity of the dam’s hydroelectric power;;;;;
plant is 912 megawatts of electricity. This power was originally mostly used by;;;;;
the aluminium smelter located at the Port of Tema on the Gulf of Guinea. Today;;;;;
the hydroelectric power plant provides electricity for more than 60% of Ghana, as;;;;;
well as for Togo, Benin and Ivory Coast.;;;;;
;;;;;
With the flooding of the Lake the road network in this region was submerged and;;;;;
the  Ghanaian  government  established  cross-lake  ferry  services  to  provide;;;;;
continuity of the major roads running through the area. Nowadays, miscellaneous;;;;;
cross-lake  ferry  services,  and  long  run  north-south  and  tramp  services  are;;;;;
provided mainly by the Volta Lake Transport Company Ltd. (VLTC), but are;;;;;
supplemented by an increasing number of private boat operators. Approximately;;;;;
500 private boat operators offer transportation services, the so called informal;;;;;
boat services, on the Volta Lake, using locally constructed motorized wooden;;;;;
boats.;;;;;
;;;;;
The average water depth of the Lake is 18.8 m, and the maximum water depth is;;;;;
given with 75.0 m, but even water depths of about 100 m have been detected;;;;;
during the Consultants’ own bathymetric surveys during July and August 2014.;;;;;
The water level of the Lake depends mainly on the amount of rainfalls during the;;;;;
rainy season (April - June) and on the hydro-electricity power requirements. For;;;;;
operation of the power plant’s turbines the water level may not be lower than 240;;;;;
feet (73.15 m) above NLD (National Level Datum). In case that the water level;;;;;
reaches the maximum of 280 feet (84.75 m) above NLD overflow spillages will;;;;;
;;;;;
HPC Hamburg Port Consulting GmbH;HPTI Hamburg Port Training Institute GmbH;;;;
;;;;;
2;Regulations and Organizational Development Plan GMA - Draft Survey Report;;;;
;;;;;
be opened to regulate the water level. VLTC north-south and tramp services;;;;;
operate to a minimum water level of 240 feet (73.15 m), but VLTC cross-ferry;;;;;
services and informal boat services operate even during lower water levels. The;;;;;
lowest water level registered during recent years has been 234.96 feet (71.62 m) in;;;;;
2007;;;;;
;;;;;
Since trees were not cut before flooding the Lake, submerged trees ending shortly;;;;;
below or even above water surface are one of the main reasons for unsafe sailing;;;;;
conditions on the Volta Lake, especially for the informal boat services during low;;;;;
water levels. Since the RoRo/Cargo vessels, ferries and pusher tugs with barges;;;;;
operated by VLTC sail on fixed routes and the main north-south route mostly;;;;;
follows the bed of the former Volta River, these vessels are generally not;;;;;
concerned by this source of unsafe navigation.;;;;;
;;;;;
The  objective  of  the  bathymetric  reconnaissance  surveys  executed  by  the;;;;;
Consultants during July and August 2014 was to inspect main navigation fairways;;;;;
and landing stages on the Volta Lake and to generate charts of the surveyed;;;;;
fairways and landing stages indicating areas where submerged trees are hazarding;;;;;
navigation of watercrafts and where it is recommended to remove these trees and;;;;;
to mark the cleared fairways with fairway markers, in order to improve safety of;;;;;
navigation on the Lake.;;;;;
;;;;;
1,2;Purpose and Structure of this Report;;;;
;;;;;
The purpose of this (Draft) Survey Report is to describe and present the outcomes;;;;;

3;METHODOLOGY OF THE BATHYMETRIC;;;;
RECONNAISSANCE SURVEYS ON THE VOLTA;;;;;
LAKE;;;;;
;;;;;
3,1;Project Preparation;;;;
;;;;;
Preparation of the bathymetric reconnaissance surveys on the Volta Lake started;;;;;
at the Consultants’ home offices shortly after the Ministry of Transport has given;;;;;
their approval to proceed with the 2nd phase of the Project on 14th April 2014. The;;;;;
preparation of the project included:;;;;;
;;;;;
·   Review of contract documents, available data, information and maps.;;;;;
;;;;;
·   Definition of scope of works, time schedule, equipment to be used,;;;;;
personnel, costing, safety issues.;;;;;
;;;;;
·   Survey planning (works, quality, procedures, standards, etc.).;;;;;
;;;;;
·   Survey datum (World Geodetic System 1984 - WGS 84, Ghana National;;;;;
Level Datum - NLD).;;;;;
;;;;;
·   Selection of equipment.;;;;;
·   Quality control procedures.;;;;;
·   Etc.;;;;;
;;;;;
On 29th May 2014 the survey launch “Geo Sounder” left the Port of Hamburg;;;;;
packed into a 40ft container. The survey launch arrived at Tema Port on the 28th;;;;;
June 2014. All survey equipment was sent via air freight from Germany to Ghana;;;;;
and arrived at Kotoka Airport on 30th June.2014. Customs clearance of the survey;;;;;
launch and equipment was completed on 7th July.2014. The next day the survey;;;;;
launch and equipment were transferred to Akosombo Port, where launching of the;;;;;
boat and installation of the equipment on board of the survey boat took place;;;;;
during the following 4 days. On 12th July 2014 several sounding lines were run for;;;;;
calibration of equipment.;;;;;

3,2;Survey Equipment;;;;
;;;;;
The following equipment to measure water depths, to establish positions and to;;;;;
measure the water  level  was used on  board  of the survey  launch  for the;;;;;
bathymetric reconnaissance surveys:;;;;;
;;;;;
·   Multi-beam echo-sounder RESON SeaBat MB 7101 with integrated side;;;;;
scan sonar.;;;;;
;;;;;
·   Differential-GPS (DGPS) positioning receiver Trimble R10.;;;;;
·   Motion sensor Octans.;;;;;
;;;;;
·   Sound velocity measurement unit SVP 14.;;;;;
;;;;;
·   Data collection computer with survey software package QINSY.;;;;;
·   Power Generator.;;;;;
;;;;;
3.2.1  Positioning System;;;;;
;;;;;
The positioning of the bathymetric surveys was done with a RTK (real time;;;;;
kinematic) DGPS signal with a typical positioning accuracy of < 10 cm in all 3;;;;;
dimensions (Northing, Easting, Elevation), using the OmniSTAR DGPS signal;;;;;
correction service. Differential corrections for GPS positioning were transmitted;;;;;
to the survey boat and corrected the coded raw pseudo ranges received from;;;;;
selected GPS satellites, allowing the boat to navigate accurately along pre-;;;;;
determined survey lines. The positions derived by the DGPS receiver were;;;;;
calculated in WGS84 co-ordinates and then transformed to a local grid.;;;;;
;;;;;
For this project the OmniSTAR HP (high precision) service, which is the most;;;;;
accurate solution available in the OmniSTAR portfolio of correction solutions,;;;;;
was used. It is a L1/L2 solution requiring a dual frequency receiver. OmniSTAR;;;;;
HP corrections are modelled on a worldwide network of reference stations using;;;;;
carrier phase measurement to maximize accuracy. The expected 2-sigma (95%);;;;;
accuracy of OmniSTAR HP is 5-10 cm. The service operates in real time and;;;;;
without the need for local base stations or telemetry links.;;;;;
;;;;;
3.2.2  Multi-Beam Echo-sounder;;;;;
;;;;;
The survey launch has been equipped with a single sonar head Reson SeaBat MB;;;;;
7101 multi-beam or swath sounding system.;;;;;
;;;;;
HPC Hamburg Port Consulting GmbH;HPTI Hamburg Port Training Institute GmbH;;;;
;;;;;
16;Regulations and Organizational Development Plan GMA - Draft Survey Report;;;;
;;;;;
The multi-beam swath bathymetry method (MBES) works on the same principle;;;;;
as the single beam sounding (SBES), with the help of ultrasonic signals at a range;;;;;
of 240-500 kHz. Thus, the topography can be measured under water.;;;;;
;;;;;
An  appropriate  MBES  system  has  several  advantages  over  SBES  systems;;;;;
according to its ability to detect small objects and to achieve almost full bottom;;;;;
coverage. Supplementary equipment, such as a motion and heading sensor has;;;;;
been integrated for correct operation. Furthermore, the angle and the speed of;;;;;
sound of the water are necessary in order to determine a depth measurement. The;;;;;
water sound velocity has been determined for this purpose by means of a;;;;;
hydrophone probe.;;;;;
;;;;;
The SeaBat MB 7101 produces bathymetry data suitable for the generation of;;;;;
high-resolution  bathymetric  maps  according  to  international  standards.  The;;;;;
system uses a frequency of 240 kHz, which is an ideal frequency for shallow;;;;;
water applications.;;;;;
;;;;;
Before commencing with the surveys the multi-beam system was calibrated by a;;;;;
technique called patch test. The patch test consists of determining the swath;;;;;
sounder due to a series of survey lines strategically sailed over various seabed;;;;;
topographies. These varying seafloor scenarios, specifically a flat seafloor (as;;;;;
deep as possible), a sloping seafloor and a conspicuous feature, enable the;;;;;
surveyor to detect and quantify the various systematic errors of the multi-beam;;;;;
equipment. In addition to a navigation time delay, the calibration survey shall;;;;;
determine the roll, pitch and heading misalignments of the transducer.;;;;;

;;;;;
3.2.3  Water Level Control;;;;;
;;;;;
The RTK-DGPS positioning system produces online Z values, which have been;;;;;
recorded on board of the survey boat. These online Z values, being accurate;;;;;
within 10 cm, have been used for precise observation of the water level. Back-up;;;;;
water level data recordings from different VRA gauge stations around the Lake;;;;;
were used for control.;;;;;
;;;;;
3.2.4  Motion Sensor;;;;;
;;;;;
The survey boat has been equipped with a motion sensor to compensate the;;;;;
acquired raw multi-beam data for heave (vertical movement), pitch and roll of the;;;;;
transducer, caused by the survey boat movements due to sea disturbances. The;;;;;
motion sensor has been deployed close to the transducer head.;;;;;
;;;;;
The survey vessel has also been equipped with a fibre optic gyro compass to;;;;;
compensate the acquired raw multi-beam data with heading.;;;;;

3,3;Data Acquisition;;;;
;;;;;
After 3 months of planning and mobilization the bathymetric reconnaissance;;;;;
surveys on the Volta Lake commenced on 13th July 2014 and were completed on;;;;;
21st August 2014. Generally, the bathymetric reconnaissance surveys followed the;;;;;
routing described under Chapter 2 from Akosombo in the south to Buipe in the;;;;;
north of the Volta Lake. The total length of all sounding lines was;2.435;;;;
kilometres (see Table 3).;;;;;
;;;;;
Table 3:   Surveyed Routes and Sounding Line Kilometers;;;;;
;;;;;
Source:   HPC, 2014.;;;;;
;;;;;
All surveys have been executed with the multi-beam echo-sounding system;;;;;
described in Chapter 3.2.2, which is imperative in nowadays bathymetric surveys,;;;;;
providing a very dense data set of the surveyed areas.;;;;;
;;;;;
With each sounding line a ground strip of about 7.5 times the water depth has;;;;;
been surveyed. Generally, all routes have been surveyed with more than one;;;;;
multi-beam sounding line. Assuming an average water depth along the routes;;;;;
being 12-60 m, and taking into consideration the required overlapping of adjacent;;;;;
;;;;;
HPTI Hamburg Port Training Institute GmbH;HPC Hamburg Port Consulting GmbH;;;;
;;;;;
Regulations and Organizational Development Plan GMA - Draft Survey Report;19;;;;
;;;;;
strips the routes have been surveyed with an average width of 200 - 250 m. In;;;;;
areas of lower water depths the width may have been decreased. The sounding;;;;;
data has been processed afterwards and bathymetric charts of the surveyed;;;;;
navigation fairways have been prepared, where special attempt has been made to;;;;;
indicate areas to be considered for removal of submerged trees and installation of;;;;;
fairway marker buoys, in order to improve safety of navigation on the Lake. The;;;;;
detailed planning of all sounding lines has been done in close co-operation with;;;;;
and under the experienced guidance and advice of GMA, VLTC and VRA.;;;;;
;;;;;
Due to the very low water levels during the surveys between 13th July and 21st;;;;;
August, being 74.25 - 74.70 m (243-245 ft) only, several landing sites could not;;;;;
be  surveyed  or  have  not  been  completely  surveyed.  The  coverage  of  the;;;;;
bathymetric reconnaissance surveys is shown in Table 4.;;;;;
;;;;;
Throughout the survey period MV Oni Panua, hired from the Volta River;;;;;
Authority (VRA), followed the surveys and served for boarding and lodging of;;;;;
the survey crew, as well as office room for preparation of surveys, data saving and;;;;;
control, etc. The experienced crew of MV Oni Panua furthermore assisted the;;;;;
Consultants’ survey crew giving advice to find the different landing stations, as;;;;;
well as the alignments of the navigation routes to be surveyed, which was an;;;;;
essential support due to the non-availability of any maps or charts of the Lake.;;;;;
;;;;;
The Daily Progress Reports attached under Annex 1 of this Report give for each;;;;;
day of survey details about:;;;;;
;;;;;
·   Staff and Equipment,;;;;;
·   Weather Conditions,;;;;;
·   Activities,;;;;;
·   Safety Issues and General Observations made.;;;;;
;;;;;

Data logging:;;;;;
;;;;;
Raw bathymetric data has been logged on a disc on the survey computer, which;;;;;
was interfaced to the positioning system, water level information, gyro, motion;;;;;
sensor and the multi-beam processor unit. Applying various filters and corrections;;;;;
for motion, tide and refraction, corrected bathymetric data could already be;;;;;
produced at the time of data acquisition.;;;;;

3,4;Data Processing and Charting;;;;
;;;;;
Data processing was carried out on site and at the home office, whereas charting;;;;;
of all surveys has been carried out solely at the home office. All survey data has;;;;;
been  processed  using  the  software  package  QUINSy  in  order  to  produce;;;;;
bathymetric charts. QUINSy is an integrated navigation system software package;;;;;
used worldwide for acquiring and processing multi-beam data. The software is;;;;;
also used for data validation.;;;;;
;;;;;
Data processing of the bathymetric survey data included the removal of erroneous;;;;;
"data, the selection of valid data and the preparation of a ""cleaned"" data set for";;;;;
further post processing. Check lines provided a comparison of data sets to validate;;;;;
the different applied parameters and helped to find any changes in vessel draft or;;;;;
squat. During data processing different kinds of parameters, such as water level;;;;;
data,  have  been  applied  and  validated.  Data  processing  also  included  the;;;;;
transformation of water depths into elevations above the vertical Reference;;;;;
System NLD (Ghana National Level Datum), as well as the subsequent analysis;;;;;
of areas with submerged trees.;;;;;
;;;;;

;;;;;
After processing and analysis of all bathymetric data, charts have been furnished;;;;;
and plotted in scale 1:2,000. The bathymetric charts present the topography of the;;;;;
bed of the Volta Lake alongside the surveyed routes within the limits of a 150 m;;;;;
wide fairway in colour-shaded 2-m-intervals of elevation above NLD. Areas;;;;;
where submerged trees have been detected are marked by surrounding polygon;;;;;
lines.;;;;;

28;Regulations and Organizational Development Plan GMA - Draft Survey Report;;;;
;Each of these survey and charting sections is described briefly in the following;;;;
;chapters. The detailed charts themselves can be found in separated files.;;;;
4,2;Section 1 - Beginning of Afram Tributary;;;;
;;;;;
Section No. 1 includes 49 sheets and starts at the northern end of the Pawn Pawn;;;;;
Bay (sheet 30) and follows the Bay in southern direction on a possible route used;;;;;
by informal boats services close to the east bank of the Pawn Pawn Bay, passing;;;;;
the landing sites of Sedom (sheet 4) and Obelemenya (sheet 1). This section also;;;;;
includes a link to the landing site of Agajajetor (sheets 48 & 49). Afterwards the;;;;;
section follows two alternative possible routes for informal boat services leading;;;;;
into the Afram Tributary (sheets 47-31), up to the junction with the fairway to the;;;;;
landing site of Akrusu on the south bank of the tributary.;;;;;
;;;;;
The survey of this section was executed on 14th, 15th and 16th July 2014. The;;;;;
water level during these days was between 74.668 m and 74.680 m above NLD.;;;;;
Surveys of landing sites at Sedom and Obelemenya were limited due to fishing;;;;;
nets in those areas. Survey speed had to be limited due to hazardous trees.;;;;;
;;;;;
Sheets 41-47 show an alternative route from Sedom / Obelemenya into the Afram,;;;;;
which is not navigable during low water levels.;;;;;
;;;;;
4,3;Section 2 - Akrusu - Akateng;;;;
;;;;;
Section No. 2 includes 27 sheets and starts at the western end of Section 1 (sheet;;;;;
24).  The section begins with a link to the landing site of Akrusu (sheets 24-26).;;;;;
The route then follows the Afram upstream, passing the fairway to Akotoe (sheet;;;;;
19). After Akotoe the section follows the Afram upstream close to its southern;;;;;
shore, passing the landing site of Akateng (sheet 8). After Akateng the route;;;;;
continues upstream close the southern bank of the Afram and stops close before;;;;;
the landing site of Akuase, where the route ends due to shallow waters (sheet 1).;;;;;
;;;;;
The survey of this section was executed on 16th and 17th July 2014. The water;;;;;
level during these days was between 74.655 m and 74.668 m above NLD.;;;;;
;;;;;
Within the 150 m wide fairway groves, where trees reach the critical depth of 70;;;;;
m NLD have been detected over the complete distance, as well as at the landing;;;;;
station of Akotoe Tsrebuanya.;;;;;
;;;;;
HPTI Hamburg Port Training Institute GmbH;HPC Hamburg Port Consulting GmbH;;;;
;;;;;
;Regulations and Organizational Development Plan GMA - Draft Survey Report;29;;;
4,4;Section 3 - Akateng - Adakope;;;;
;;;;;
Section No. 3 includes 42 sheets and starts where Section 2 turns south direction;;;;;
to Akateng (sheet 15 of section 2). The route follows the Afram upstream in;;;;;
north-western direction, passing the fairways to Akuse (sheets 30 & 31), Odotorm;;;;;
(sheets 39-41), Petefour (sheets 24 & 25), Nar Panya (sheets 36-38) and Adakope;;;;;
(sheets 22 & 23). This section ends north of Adakope, where the route turns;;;;;
sharply to northern direction (sheet 1).;;;;;
;;;;;
The survey of this section was executed between 18th and 20th July 2014. The;;;;;
water level during these days was between 74.619 m and 74.646 m above NLD.;;;;;
Due to trees endangering the navigation of the survey launch survey speed had to;;;;;
be reduced drastically and survey of landing sites of Petefour and Nar Panya was;;;;;
limited.;;;;;
;;;;;
Dense vegetation of submerged trees reaching the critical depth of 70 m NLD has;;;;;
been detected on the fairways to the landing sites of Akuase, Odotorm, Petefour,;;;;;
Nar Panya and Adakope.;;;;;
;;;;;
4,5;Section 4 - Adakope - Nketepa;;;;
;;;;;
Section No. 4 consists of 11 sheets and starts west (upstream) of section 3, at the;;;;;
landing site of Adakope (sheet 11). The route follows the Afram upstream in;;;;;
north-western direction, until the longitude of 0°20’59”W.;;;;;
;;;;;
The survey of this section was executed on 20th and 21st July 2014. The water;;;;;
level during these days was between 74.610 and 74.619 m above NLD.;;;;;
;;;;;
Dense vegetation of submerged trees reaching the critical depth of 70 m NLD has;;;;;
been detected on the fairway to the landing site of Adakope.;;;;;
;;;;;
4,6;Section 5 - Nketepa - Ekye Amanfrom - Hyewohodin;;;;
;;;;;
Section No. 5 includes 32 sheets and starts west (upstream) of section 4, at the;;;;;
longitude of 0°20’59”W. Sheets 29-31 show an alternative southern fairway to the;;;;;
landing site of Tremeleveme, but surveys of this fairway had to be stopped due to;;;;;
shallow waters at the latitude of 6°38’27”N.;;;;;
;;;;;
The section then follows the Afram upstream in north-western direction, passing;;;;;
the landing site of Nketepa (sheet 24), the fairway to Asuboni (sheet 17), and the;;;;;
fairway to Adawso (sheet 10). The landing site of Ekye-Amanfrom is shown on;;;;;
sheet 7.;;;;;
;;;;;

;;;;;
30;Regulations and Organizational Development Plan GMA - Draft Survey Report;;;;
;;;;;
Afterwards the route follows direction to Hyewohodin, but due to low water level;;;;;
surveys had to be stopped at the longitude of 0°33’22”W (sheet 1). Sheets 8, 6 and;;;;;
4 show an alternative route between Ekye-Amanfrom and Hyewohodin that is;;;;;
navigable during low water levels.;;;;;
;;;;;
The survey of this section was executed between 21st and 23rd July 2014. The;;;;;
water level during these days was between 74.573 and 74.610 m above NLD. Due;;;;;
to dense vegetation of trees the fairway between Adawso and Hyewohodin could;;;;;
not be completely surveyed. During the surveys it was realized that the buoys;;;;;
marking the ferry crossing between Adawso and Ekye Amanfrom are not on their;;;;;
correct positions. They have to be repositioned, since there are tree stumps within;;;;;
the marked fairway.;;;;;
;;;;;
Dense vegetation of submerged trees reaching the critical depth of 70 m NLD has;;;;;
been   detected   all   over   the   complete   route   between   Tremelevene   and;;;;;
Hoyewohodin.;;;;;
;;;;;

4.26   Section 42 - Main South-North Route;;;;;
;;;;;
Section 42 includes 329 sheets and follows the routing of the VLTC main service;;;;;
from south to north, starting from the Port of Akosombo (sheets 323-329) and;;;;;
ending at the latitude of 8°37’13”N, close the confluent of the Black Volta and the;;;;;
White Volta Rivers (sheet 1). Since this route follows mainly the bed of the;;;;;
former Volta River, generally no submerged trees endanger the navigation of;;;;;
vessels and boats on this route. Only where this route leaves the river bed to;;;;;
shorten the way (e.g. between Kpandu and Awatetone) areas with submerged tress;;;;;
are crossed.;;;;;
;;;;;
In the southern part of this route (sheets 281-329) water depths are in the range of;;;;;
20 - 75 m below the minimum operable water level of 73.15 m above NLD.;;;;;
South of the confluent of the Black Volta and White Volta River water depths are;;;;;
still in the range of 5 - 10 m below the minimum operable water level.;;;;;
;;;;;
Sheets 308-311 cover the south-eastern part of the Volta Lake between the dam;;;;;
and the junction with the fairway leading to the port of Akosombo. In this part;;;;;
even water depths of about 100 m below the minimum water level have been;;;;;
detected.;;;;;
;;;;;

4.27   Section 43 - Black and White Volta River;;;;;
;;;;;
Section 43 includes 85 sheets and starts north of section 43 at the latitude of;;;;;
8°37’22”N (sheet 61). Section 43 follows the routing of the VLTC main service;;;;;
up to Buipe (sheet 1). This section furthermore covers the White Volta River;;;;;
between the confluent with the Black Volta River and 8°49’11”N, 1°04’11”W;;;;;
(sheets 62-85).;;;;;
;;;;;
The confluent of the White Volta River with the Black Volta River is shown on;;;;;
sheet 53. Upstream of 8°41’35”N, 1°01’32”W the natural width of the fairway;;;;;
during low water is reduced to less than 90 m (sheet 43).;;;;;
;;;;;
Upstream of the landing station of Debre (sheet 20) the bed of the Black Volta;;;;;
River  reaches  an  altitude  of  more  than;71.5 m  (west of  the  longitude  of;;;;
1°17’04”W, sheet;18), thus reducing the water depth during the  minimum;;;;
operable water level of 73.15 m NLD to 1.65 m only. Upstream of 8°43’15.30”N,;;;;;
1°18’15”W the altitude of the river bed increases to more than 72 m and the;;;;;
natural width of the fairway is reduced to 80 m only. Upstream of the longitude of;;;;;
1°24’40”W the altitude of the river bed increases to more than 72.5 m, reducing;;;;;
the water depths during the water level of 73.15 m to 0.65 m only.;;;;;
;;;;;
The altitude of the river bed of the White Volta River starts at 66-68 m above;;;;;
NLD at the confluent with the Black Volta River (sheet 85), the natural width of;;;;;
the fairway at this position is about 150 m. Upstream of 8°43’52”N the altitude of;;;;;
the river bed increases to 68-70 m above NLD, and the natural width of the;;;;;
fairway is reduced to about 135 m (sheet 77).;;;;;
;;;;;
Shallow waters with the altitude of the river bed reaching more than 70 m NLD;;;;;
can be found between 8°45’24”N and 8°45’50”N (sheet 74), between 8°48’13”N,;;;;;
1°02’21”W and 8°48’39”N, 1°02’41”W (sheets 65,66), and finally upstream of;;;;;
8°49’52”N, 1°03’26”W until 8°49’04”N, 1°04’32”W (sheets 63, 62), where the;;;;;
bathymetric surveys had to be stopped at about 30 km upstream due to very;;;;;
shallow waters that made navigation of the survey launch impossible.;;;;;
;;;;;
The surveys of section 42 were executed between 9th and 13th August 2014. The;;;;;
water level during these days ranged between 74.384 m and 74.448 m above;;;;;
NLD. Fishing nets were endangering navigation of the survey launch between;;;;;
Yeji and the confluence of Black and White Volta.;;;;;

;;;;;
·   Yapei Queen (RoRo Cargo Vessel),;;;;;
·   Ferries,;;;;;
;;;;;
·   Barges and Push Boats,;;;;;
;;;;;
·   Informal Boats with outboard engines.;;;;;
;;;;;
The dimensions of these design vessels (draft, beam) and the resulting minimum;;;;;

crafts on the Lake during minimum operable water levels. On the basis of this;;;;;
table 70.0 m above NLD have been chosen as the design level for cutting of;;;;;
submerged trees, in order to enable for safe navigation of water crafts during all;;;;;
water levels.;;;;;
;;;;;
Most of the approach channels to the landing stages shall be marked by channel;;;;;
marker buoys. The positions of these buoys will vary due to the variation of the;;;;;
water level of the Lake, resulting in the requirement that trees not only have to be;;;;;
cut within the width of the approach channel, but within the minimum clearance;;;;;
width shown in the following table. Reference is again made to INROS-Lackner /;;;;;

In order enhance the safety of navigation on the Lake and to minimize the;;;;;
intervention into the Lake’s nature it is recommended to cut only those trees;;;;;
within the required clearance widths of the approach channels and in front of the;;;;;
landing stages that reach at least the design level of 70.0 m above NLD. Trees that;;;;;
do not reach this level shall not be cut.;;;;;

services according to Chapter 2.3. For fairways, figures of all landing stations;;;;;
served by the fairway have been added.;;;;;
;;;;;
Design width of approach channel:;;;;;
Reference is made to Table 6.;;;;;
;;;;;
Approximate clearance width for approach channel:;;;;;
;;;;;
Reference is made to Table 7. In cases where only selective cutting of trees is;;;;;
required, clearance width has been set to 150 m. In front of landing stations;;;;;
clearance width has been set to 300 m.;;;;;
;;;;;
Requirement for cutting of trees:;;;;;
;;;;;
See above. Only trees that reach at least the design level of 70.0 m above NLD;;;;;
shall be cut.;;;;;
;;;;;
Approximate area to be cleared from submerged trees:;;;;;
;;;;;
Ares have been determined on the basis of the bathymetric reconnaissance survey.;;;;;
For landing stations that haven not been surveyed, because of low water level or;;;;;
high density of trees, it is assumed that complete approach channel and/or landing;;;;;
station must be cleared.;;;;;
;;;;;
Approximate number of trees to be cut:;;;;;
;;;;;
For landing stations that have not been surveyed, it is assumed that 2 trees of;;;;;
diameter < 0.1 m and 1 tree of diameter > 0.1 m have to be cut per hectare.;;;;;
Reference is made to the INROS-Lackner / BANS Final Interim Report. For;;;;;

;;;;;
landing stations and fairways that have been surveyed, it is assumed that 20 trees;;;;;
of diameter < 0.1 m and 10 trees of diameter > 0.1 m have to be cut per hectare.;;;;;
The higher density is assumed, since dedicated areas with trees that reach the;;;;;
design level of 70.0 m above NLD could be detected by bathymetric surveys.;;;;;
;;;;;
Costs for cutting of trees:;;;;;
;;;;;
Costs for cutting of submerged trees have been estimated on the following basis:;;;;;
·   Cutting of submerged trees with diameter < 0.1 m - 85 USD,;;;;;
·   Cutting of submerged trees with diameter > 0.1 m - 150 USD,;;;;;
·   Dedicated survey to select submerged trees: 850 USD per ha.;;;;;
Reference is made to the INROS-Lackner / BANS Final Interim Report.;;;;;
Requirement for installation of navigational aids:;;;;;
;;;;;
All fairways, except the VLT north-south route, shall either be marked by fairway;;;;;
markers (cardinal buoys) or be channel markers (lateral buoys). Narrow channels;;;;;
crossing dense vegetation of submerged trees shall be marked by channel markers;;;;;
on their port side and starboard side. Distance between channel marker buoys on;;;;;
each side of the channel shall be about 500 m. Reference is made to the INROS-;;;;;
Lackner / BANS Final Interim Report. Open channels shall be marked on their;;;;;
axis by fairway markers in order to assist especially informal boat services to keep;;;;;
their route within a cleaned and safe channel. Distance between the fairway;;;;;
markers shall be about 2,000 m.;;;;;
;;;;;
In order to improve the safety of navigation on the main north-south route it is;;;;;
recommended to equip all VLTC crafts operating on this route with electronic;;;;;
track-plotters enabling navigation by waypoints. Thus, installation of fairway;;;;;
markers on this route is obsolete.;;;;;
;;;;;
Number of buoys to be set-out:;;;;;
;;;;;
The number of buoys to be set-out has been calculated under the assumption that;;;;;
open fairways are marked by 1 fairway buoy per 2,000 m, narrow channels by 1;;;;;
pair of channel marker buoys per 500 m. Widening of the channel to a width of;;;;;
300 m in front of the landing station has been considered.;;;;;

Costs for supply and setting-out of buoys:;;;;;
;;;;;
Costs for supply and setting-out of buoys, including chains and sinkers, have been;;;;;
estimated on the following basis:;;;;;
;;;;;
·   Channel marker buoy - 5,000 USD,;;;;;
·   Fairway buoy - 15,000 USD.;;;;;
;;;;;
For costs of channel marker buoys reference is made to the INROS-Lackner /;;;;;

Between 8°33’16” N and 8°33’48”N dredging works are recommended within a;;;;;
sequence of the navigation route where the altitude is higher than 68 m NLD, in;;;;;
order to improve the water depths. The total area to be dredged covers about 15.4;;;;;
hectares. The dredging volume is estimated being about 200,000 cubic-metres.;;;;;
Dredging costs are estimated to about 2,000,000 USD.;;;;;

Upstream of the landing station of Debre the bed of the Black Volta River reaches;;;;;
an altitude of more than 71.5 m NLD (west of the Longitude of 1°17’04”W), thus;;;;;
reducing the water depth during the minimum operable water level of 73.15 m;;;;;
above NLD to 1.65 m only. Upstream of 8°43’15.30”N, 1°18’15”W the altitude of;;;;;
the river bed increases to more than 72 m above NLD and the natural width of the;;;;;
fairway is reduced to 80 m only. Upstream of the longitude of 1°24’40”W the;;;;;
altitude of the river bed increases to more than 72.5 m above NLD, which makes;;;;;
navigation with pushers and barges unsafe during water levels of less than 74.65;;;;;
m above NLD.;;;;;

Navigation of pushers and barges during low water levels of 73.15 m above NLD;;;;;
will require extensive dredging works over the last 20 km before the fairway;;;;;
reaches Buipe. The volume of sand to be dredged in this section is estimated with;;;;;
3.1 mio. cbm, taking into consideration a channel width of 90 m. Under the;;;;;
assumption of a unit rate of 100 USD per cubic meter, dredging costs are;;;;;
estimated being about 31,000,000 USD.;;;;;

The White Volta River will be navigable for boats with a maximum draft of 0.8 m;;;;;
during the minimum operable water level of 73.15 m above NLD upstream until;;;;;
the latitude of;8°45’24”N (13 km upstream, without restrictions), and until;;;;
8°49’04”N, 1°04’32”W (28 km upstream, with restrictions).;;;;;
;;;;;
In order to improve the safety of navigation on this part of the White Volta River;;;;;
the axis of fairway might be marked with fairway buoys (cardinal buoys). The;;;;;
maximum distance between these buoys should be about 2,000 m.;;;;;
